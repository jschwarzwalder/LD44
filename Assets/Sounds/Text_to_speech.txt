Oh no, all your life has been spent. Such a loss.

------

The year is 2079, you are the lone survivor of a science experiment that allows you to shoot lasers out of your hands.  Humans worked with other worlders to develop this technology. 

After seeing the other participants lose their life during training, you ran away to a secluded mountain where you hoped to find peace. 

Here you discovered that every time you shoot a laser, a little piece of your life is sacrificed. Little did you know that the government has been searching for you. 

Now faced with having to return, your only choice is to shoot down the aircraft, that have come looking for you. 

-------

Congratulations, you survived this wave [with your life intact]. Today, a life has been saved. 

-------

See the aircraft up ahead?

Wait for them to get closer before trying to shoot.  Your hands do not work long distances. 

------

Congratulations you have won Lifser VR. Spend your Life to save it.

The Government has decided that laser hands are not worth the cost. You can now live your life in peace.
